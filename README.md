# RUWarehouse
This project stimulates a warehouse that stores Rutgers merch. This project supports users'  storing up to 50 different items, looking up products efficiently, and deleting less popular items to make space for new product. All potential errors have been handled , and the program should alert the user in the event of such an error.
